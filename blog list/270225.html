    <p1>What is someone's worth? How do we determine it. Well generally in society people may have very different opinions regarding that. Just like Bibhutibhusan once said 
        , we apply worth to someone on our own whims.

        When it comes to college, It is quite evident that there is a sharp hierarchy among students of different years. And it is also quite evident that freshmen are treated
        like stalin's subjugated citigens under USSR. Their existence is only acknowleged also long as they are of some use. It is not
        necessarily a bad thing, this hierarchy's existence may just be as old as time itself. I wouldn't call it unfair either because one day the freshmen will become a sophomore
        and will inflict his new-bred status to the newcomers. That's just how it has always worked, always will. As long as civilization exists.
