I had spent most of my life cycling, and part of it by walking. Even a small town like mine seem a lot bigger
when you go slow. Perhaps, What I mean is that for humans value equals how unattainable something is. In fact
distance is directly proportional to it's value, the further something is, the more valuable it becomes.

    I say this because recently travelling with a motorbike has become very common for me, and somewhere in my mind
    my small town has only began to grow smaller and smaller. Imagine it as the opposite of the expanding universe,
    the world is shrinking. It reminds of a old song, one of my favourites since childhood, <a href="https://youtu.

    You know, I did read something of similar note before, In Aranyak perhaps, Bibhutibhusan Bandyopadhyay. Not that it matters.
    Most of my life was spent clicking pictures of my surroundings. Not that I regret any of it. On the contrary I think i
    could do more.

    People are never happy...They are never happy enough to let go of their greed. Of course I am not excluding myself from this
    statement at all. More so the opposite, I am especially talking about myself perhaps. When I was small, as we all were, There
    were small and silly things that made me happy, and maybe made you happy too. i think the feeling was something similar to entering
    a open world game. it's a new world, every little detail never fails to make you wonder. It's a goof feeling. that's what it felt back
    then, just constatly, that delightful feeling of wonder. Does that make one think? Humans are just slaves to their freedom. When you
    have infinite space, You have no space, Because how do you know you are going anywhere at all.Imagine yourself in a white void, Just
    vast infinite landscape of nothing but nothingness. That's what the universe is like, except dark, really really dark.  but it doesn't
    make you wonder, At least for me. It throws down a shiver down my spine. Question my very being. Therefore I don't think and therefore I....am 
    not. I never was. I never will be.
